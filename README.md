# Alzheimer_analysis
Descriptive analytics, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, logistic regression, and feature selection.

This project focuses on finding a model able to predict if a person is more likely to have Alzheimerâ€™s based on a dataset with many characteristics of patients divided into two groups: demented and not demented. In order to do this, certain tasks will be completed using R: Descriptive analytics, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, logistic regression, and feature selection.
